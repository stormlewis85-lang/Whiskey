I need your approval to write the test files. The Write tool is asking for permission. Could you please grant permission to write files so I can create the test?

In the meantime, let me summarize what I'm trying to create:

**Test File: `server/tests/whiskey-delete.test.ts`**

This test file covers:

1. **WHI-030**: Delete whiskey endpoint
   - Verifies DELETE /api/whiskeys/:id returns 200 and removes the whiskey
   - Verifies deleted whiskey returns 404 on subsequent GET
   - Verifies unauthenticated delete returns 401
   - Verifies non-existent whiskey returns 404
   - Verifies invalid ID format returns 400

2. **WHI-033**: Session token valid with fresh login
   - Tests the full flow: register GÂ∆ login GÂ∆ create whiskey GÂ∆ delete whiskey
   - Verifies that a fresh login session can successfully delete whiskeys
   - Tests logout GÂ∆ re-login GÂ∆ create GÂ∆ delete flow

I also need to:
1. Update `package.json` to add test scripts
2. Create a vitest configuration file
3. Install vitest and supertest dev dependencies

Would you like me to proceed once I have write permissions?
