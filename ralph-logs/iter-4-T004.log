## T004 Results: Run Existing Tests

**Pass/Fail Count:** N/A - No automated tests exist

### Findings:

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Test script in package.json | G¥î None |
| Test files in server/ | G¥î None |
| Test files in client/ | G¥î None |
| Test framework installed | G¥î None |

### Available npm scripts:
- `dev` - Development server
- `build` - Production build
- `start` - Production server
- `check` - TypeScript checking
- `db:push` - Database migrations

### Recommendation:
The project has a comprehensive test plan in `specs/TESTING.md` (96 tests across 10 sections), but no automated tests have been implemented. The tasks in Phase 2 (T030-T061) are specifically for writing these tests.

I need write permission to update TASKS.md with the status and result. Would you like me to proceed with that update and commit?
