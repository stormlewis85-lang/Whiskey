## T003 Complete - Environment Variables Verification

### Summary

I have completed the verification of environment variables for the WhiskeyPedia application.

**Result: G£‡ PASS** (with notes)

### Verification Details

#### Variables Required by the Actual Code:

| Variable | Required | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | G£‡ Present and configured |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | G£‡ Present and configured |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | G‹·n+≈ Present but empty |
| `NODE_ENV` | Optional | Not set (defaults to development) |

#### Key Findings:

1. **Core functionality works:** `DATABASE_URL` and `SESSION_SECRET` are properly configured
2. **ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is empty:** The AI tasting notes feature will fail gracefully (returns 503 error) until an API key is added
3. **Documentation mismatch:** The ARCHITECTURE.md lists `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`, `PORT`, and `VITE_API_URL` but these are not actually used:
   - The code uses `SESSION_SECRET` instead of `JWT_SECRET`
   - Port is hardcoded to 5000 in `server/index.ts:104`
   - Client uses relative URLs (no `VITE_API_URL` needed)

#### Note for Task T121 (Phase 5):
The ARCHITECTURE.md environment variables section should be updated to reflect the actual variables used in code.

I was unable to update TASKS.md and make a git commit due to permission issues. The task verification is complete and the environment variables are properly configured for the application to run (except AI features which require `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be populated).
